\section*{Preamble}
We the people of the University of Tennessee, in order to form a more perfect hacking team, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Hacking Team at the University of Tennessee, heretofore HackUT.

\section*{Purpose}
We shall set forth on undetermined days at undetermined times to engage in l337 hacks.  These hacks shall be performed with the object of obtaining maximum p0wn4ge and shall be performed in accordance with the principles outlined in the Hacker's Manifesto.

\section*{Membership}
Membership shall be a free and open to all students regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, pregnancy, marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, physical or mental disability, or covered veteran status, but not editor preference.  Those who prefer GNU Emacs, or even posess the capacity to close GNU Emacs when it is accidentally opened, shall not be permitted entrace into HackUT.  Prospective members shall submit a skill set and public RSA key for evaluation.  If they are unable to produce a public RSA key or their skill set document is produced in Microsoft Word, they are ill-fit for the organization and shall be denied entrance as if they preferred GNU Emacs.

\section*{Officers}
Officers must be full-time students in good academic standing and may be considered ineligible for office if on disciplinary probation for violating any student standards of conduct.  Officers shall be randomly elected based on a lottery.  The lottery shall be conducted by executing the code sample in figure 1.  Members who are declared officers shall be officers.  In the event that no officers are selected, the script shall be run again.  Officer assignment shall occur at each moment the Unix time is divisible by ten million.

\section*{Meetings}
As mentioned in our purpose statement, the purpose of the organization shall be to engage in l337 hacks of maximum p0wn4ge.  To this end, the organization shall meet every Tuesday.

\section*{Financial Matters}
All financial transactions shall take place either through bartering, Bitcoin, or untraceable cash transactions.  Receipts shall be issued in the form of RSA signatures using keys of at least 2048 bits.  Financial statements shall be issued annually.  If any funds remain upon the disolution of the group, they shall be donated in equal part to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Tor Project, and the Free Software Foundation.

\section*{Advisor}
Advisors shall be selected based upon maximum l337ness and p0wn4ge.  The advisor must be a ful-time faculty or staff member at the University of Tennessee, and the advisor shall review the budget and financial statements of the organization with the officers.
